        INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM (IEP)
        
        Student: Emma Johnson
        Date of Birth: March 15, 2015
        Grade: 3rd Grade
        School: Lincoln Elementary School
        
        PRESENT LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE:
        Emma demonstrates strengths in verbal communication and social interaction with peers. She shows enthusiasm for learning and participates actively in group discussions. However, Emma experiences significant challenges in reading comprehension and mathematical reasoning that impact her academic performance across multiple subjects.
        
        ANNUAL GOALS:
        
        Goal 1 - Reading Comprehension:
        By the end of the school year, when given grade-level text, Emma will demonstrate improved reading comprehension by correctly answering 4 out of 5 questions about main idea, supporting details, and story sequence, as measured by teacher-created assessments administered monthly.
        
        Goal 2 - Mathematics:
        By the end of the school year, Emma will solve two-digit addition and subtraction problems with regrouping with 80% accuracy over three consecutive trials, as measured by weekly math assessments.
        
        Goal 3 - Social Skills:
        Emma will initiate appropriate social interactions with peers during unstructured activities (recess, lunch) at least 3 times per day, documented through teacher observation logs collected weekly.
        
        SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES:
        - Resource Room Support: 45 minutes daily for reading and math instruction
        - Speech-Language Therapy: 30 minutes twice weekly for language processing
        - Occupational Therapy: 30 minutes weekly for fine motor skills
        
        ACCOMMODATIONS:
        - Extended time (50% additional) for all tests and assignments
        - Preferential seating near the teacher
        - Frequent breaks during lengthy assignments
        - Use of manipulatives for math problems
        - Text-to-speech software for reading assignments
        
        PROGRESS MONITORING:
        Progress will be monitored monthly through curriculum-based measurements, teacher observations, and standardized assessment tools. Parents will receive progress reports quarterly.
        
        TRANSITION SERVICES:
        Age-appropriate transition activities will be developed focusing on self-advocacy skills and independence in academic tasks.
